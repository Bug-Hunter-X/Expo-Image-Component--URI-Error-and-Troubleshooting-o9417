This error typically occurs when using Expo's `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  Here's a breakdown of common causes and how to debug them:

**1. Incorrect URI:**

* **Typographical Errors:** Double-check the URI for any typos. Even a small mistake can prevent the image from loading.
* **Incorrect Protocol:** Ensure you're using `http://` or `https://` at the beginning of the URI, depending on the source.
* **Missing or Incorrect File Path:** Verify that the file path within the URI is correct.  If the image is in your project's assets folder (e.g., `assets/images/myimage.jpg`), ensure you're referencing it correctly.
* **Case Sensitivity:** File paths are often case-sensitive. Pay attention to capitalization in your URI.

**2. Network Issues:**

* **Server Errors:** If the image is hosted on a remote server, ensure the server is running correctly and that the image is accessible. Use your browser to directly access the URI to check.
* **Network Connectivity:** Confirm that your device or emulator has a stable internet connection if the image is remote.
* **Firewall or Proxy:**  A firewall or proxy could be blocking access to the image. Temporarily disable these to test.

**3. Caching Issues:**

* **Clearing the Cache:** Sometimes, the Expo app or the browser cache can contain outdated or corrupt image data. Try clearing the cache of the Expo app or your browser to force a refresh.

**4. Permissions:**

* **Asset Permissions:** If you are using local images, verify that the Expo app has the necessary permissions to access those assets.

**5. Image Format:**

* **Unsupported Format:** Ensure that the image format is supported by Expo's `Image` component. Popular formats include JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.

**Example of Incorrect URI:**
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'htp://example.com/image.jpg' }} />
```
This will fail due to a typo in 'http'.

**Debugging Steps:**

1. **Console Logging:** Use `console.log()` to print the URI you're using to the console.  This allows you to inspect it for errors.
2. **Direct Access:** Try accessing the image URI directly in your web browser. This confirms if the image is accessible from the network.
3. **Simplify:** Create a minimal example to isolate the problem.  Use a simple image source, eliminating any other variables in your code that may be interfering.
4. **Check Network Tab:**  In your browser's developer tools, examine the network requests to see if the image is being requested and whether it returns an error.
