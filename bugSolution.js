The solution involves careful checking of the image URI and addressing potential network or caching issues. Here's how to fix it:

**1. Correct the URI:**

Double-check the spelling and syntax of the image URI.  Ensure you have the correct protocol (`http://` or `https://`) and a valid path to the image.

**2. Network Connectivity:**

Ensure your device has a working internet connection if you're loading the image from a remote server. Test the URI in your browser to confirm that it works independently.

**3. Clear Cache:**

If the issue persists, try clearing the cache of the Expo Go app (or your development environment).  Sometimes corrupted cache data can prevent image loading.

**4. Local Images:**

For local images, make sure they are correctly placed in your `assets` folder and referenced appropriately.  The correct relative path within the app is crucial.

**Example of Correct URI:**
```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'https://example.com/image.jpg' }} />
```

**Revised Code (bugSolution.js):**
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { Image, View } from 'react-native-web'; // Or 'react-native'

export default function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <View>
      <Image
        style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }}
        source={{
          uri: 'https://images.example.com/myimage.jpg', // Use a valid URI
        }}
      />
    </View>
  );
}
```
Remember to replace `'https://images.example.com/myimage.jpg'` with the actual path of your image.
